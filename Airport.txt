Passenger(ID_psg, name)
Pass_in_trip(trip_no, date, ID_psg, place)
The Company table contains IDs and names of the airlines transporting passengers. The Trip table contains information on the
schedule of flights: trip (flight) number, company (airline) ID, plane type, departure city, destination city, departure time, and
arrival time. The Passenger table holds IDs and names of the passengers. The Pass_in_trip table contains data on flight bookings:

- departure and arrival times are specified with one minute precision;
- there can be several passengers bearing the same first name and surname (for example, Bruce Willis);
- the seat (place) designation consists of a number followed by a letter; the number stands for the row, while the letter (a â€“ d)
defines the seat position in the grid (from left to right, in alphabetical order.
