Database description "Airport":
The database schema consists of 4 tables:
Company(ID_comp, name)
Trip(trip_no, id_comp, plane, town_from, town_to, time_out, time_in)
Passenger(ID_psg, name)
Pass_in_trip(trip_no, date, ID_psg, place)
The Company table contains IDs and names of the airlines transporting passengers. The Trip table contains information on the
schedule of flights: trip (flight) number, company (airline) ID, plane type, departure city, destination city, departure time, and
arrival time. The Passenger table holds IDs and names of the passengers. The Pass_in_trip table contains data on flight bookings:
trip number, departure date (day), passenger ID and her seat (place) designation during the flight. It should be noted that
- scheduled flights are operated daily; the duration of any flight is less than 24 hours; town_from <> town_to;
- all time and date values are assumed to belong to the same time zone;
- departure and arrival times are specified with one minute precision;
- there can be several passengers bearing the same first name and surname (for example, Bruce Willis);
- the seat (place) designation consists of a number followed by a letter; the number stands for the row, while the letter (a â€“ d)
defines the seat position in the grid (from left to right, in alphabetical order.

Exercise: 63 (Serge I: 2003-04-08)
Find the names of different passengers that ever travelled more than once occupying seats with the same number.

Solution:
SELECT name
FROM Passenger
WHERE ID_psg IN (SELECT ID_psg FROM Pass_in_trip GROUP BY place, ID_psg HAVING COUNT(*) > 1)

Exercise: 66 (Serge I: 2003-04-09)
For all days between 2003-04-01 and 2003-04-07 find the number of trips from Rostov.
Result set: date, number of trips.

Solution:
WITH recD AS
(SELECT CAST('2003-04-01' AS datetime) AS Dt
UNION ALL
SELECT Dt+1 FROM recD
WHERE Dt < '2003-04-07')

SELECT Dt, COUNT(DISTINCT trip_no) AS count
FROM recD LEFT JOIN Pass_in_trip ON
				Dt = date AND
				trip_no IN (SELECT trip_no FROM Trip WHERE town_from = 'Rostov')
GROUP BY Dt

Exercise: 67 (Serge I: 2010-03-27)
Find out the number of routes with the greatest number of flights (trips).
Notes.
1) A - B and B - A are to be considered DIFFERENT routes.
2) Use the Trip table only.

Solution:
WITH cc AS
(SELECT town_from, town_to, COUNT(trip_no) AS count
FROM Trip
GROUP BY town_from, town_to)

SELECT COUNT(*) as qty
FROM (SELECT TOP 1 WITH TIES count
FROM cc
ORDER BY count DESC) s

Exercise: 68 (Serge I: 2010-03-27)
Find out the number of routes with the greatest number of flights (trips).
Notes.
1) A - B and B - A are to be considered the SAME route.
2) Use the Trip table only.

Solution:
WITH cc AS
(SELECT town_from, town_to, COUNT(trip_no) AS count
FROM Trip
WHERE town_from >= town_to
GROUP BY town_from, town_to
UNION ALL
SELECT town_to, town_from, COUNT(trip_no) AS count
FROM Trip
WHERE town_to > town_from
GROUP BY town_to, town_from),
scc AS
(SELECT town_from, town_to, SUM(count) AS scount
FROM cc
GROUP BY town_from, town_to)

SELECT COUNT(*) as qty
FROM (SELECT TOP 1 WITH TIES scount
FROM scc
ORDER BY scount DESC) s
