Database description "Recycling firm":
The firm owns several buy-back centers for collection of recyclable materials. Each of
them receives funds to be paid to the recyclables suppliers. Data on funds received is
recorded in the table
Income_o(point, date, inc)
The primary key is (point, date), where point holds the identifier of the buy-back center,
and date corresponds to the calendar date the funds were received. The date column doesn’t
include the time part, thus, money (inc) arrives no more than once a day for each center.
Information on payments to the recyclables suppliers is held in the table
Outcome_o(point, date, out)
In this table, the primary key (point, date) ensures each buy-back center reports about
payments (out) no more than once a day, too.
For the case income and expenditure may occur more than once a day, another database
schema with tables having a primary key consisting of the single column code is used:
Income(code, point, date, inc)
Outcome(code, point, date, out)
Here, the date column doesn’t include the time part, either.

Exercise: 29 (Serge I: 2003-02-14)
Under the assumption that receipts of money (inc) and payouts (out) are registered not more than once a day for each collection point
[i.e. the primary key consists of (point, date)], write a query displaying cash flow data (point, date, income, expense).
Use Income_o and Outcome_o tables.

Solution:
SELECT Income_o.point, Income_o.date, inc, out
FROM Income_o LEFT JOIN Outcome_o ON Income_o.date = Outcome_o.date AND Income_o.point = Outcome_o.point
UNION
SELECT Outcome_o.point, Outcome_o.date, inc, out
FROM Income_o RIGHT JOIN Outcome_o ON Income_o.date = Outcome_o.date AND Income_o.point = Outcome_o.point

Exercise: 30 (Serge I: 2003-02-14)
Under the assumption that receipts of money (inc) and payouts (out) can be registered any number of times a day for each collection point
[i.e. the code column is the primary key], display a table with one corresponding row for each operating date of each collection point.
Result set: point, date, total payout per day (out), total money intake per day (inc).
Missing values are considered to be NULL.

Solution:
SELECT DISTINCT point, date, SUM(out) AS outcome, SUM(inc) AS income
FROM (SELECT Income.point, Income.date, out, inc
FROM Income LEFT JOIN Outcome ON Income.point = Outcome.point AND Income.date = Outcome.date AND Income.code = Outcome.code
UNION ALL
SELECT Outcome.point, Outcome.date, out, inc
FROM Outcome LEFT JOIN Income ON Income.point = Outcome.point AND Income.date = Outcome.date AND Income.code = Outcome.code) AS p
GROUP BY point, date
