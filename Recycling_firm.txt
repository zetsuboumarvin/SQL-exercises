Database description "Recycling firm":
The firm owns several buy-back centers for collection of recyclable materials. Each of
them receives funds to be paid to the recyclables suppliers. Data on funds received is
recorded in the table
Income_o(point, date, inc)
The primary key is (point, date), where point holds the identifier of the buy-back center,
and date corresponds to the calendar date the funds were received. The date column doesn’t
include the time part, thus, money (inc) arrives no more than once a day for each center.
Information on payments to the recyclables suppliers is held in the table
Outcome_o(point, date, out)
In this table, the primary key (point, date) ensures each buy-back center reports about
payments (out) no more than once a day, too.
For the case income and expenditure may occur more than once a day, another database
schema with tables having a primary key consisting of the single column code is used:
Income(code, point, date, inc)
Outcome(code, point, date, out)
Here, the date column doesn’t include the time part, either.

Exercise: 29 (Serge I: 2003-02-14)
Under the assumption that receipts of money (inc) and payouts (out) are registered not more than once
a day for each collection point
[i.e. the primary key consists of (point, date)], write a query displaying cash flow data (point,
date, income, expense).
Use Income_o and Outcome_o tables.

Solution:
SELECT Income_o.point, Income_o.date, inc, out
FROM Income_o LEFT JOIN Outcome_o ON Income_o.date = Outcome_o.date AND Income_o.point = Outcome_o.point
UNION
SELECT Outcome_o.point, Outcome_o.date, inc, out
FROM Income_o RIGHT JOIN Outcome_o ON Income_o.date = Outcome_o.date AND Income_o.point = Outcome_o.point

Exercise: 30 (Serge I: 2003-02-14)
Under the assumption that receipts of money (inc) and payouts (out) can be registered any number of times
a day for each collection point
[i.e. the code column is the primary key], display a table with one corresponding row for each operating
date of each collection point.
Result set: point, date, total payout per day (out), total money intake per day (inc).
Missing values are considered to be NULL.

Solution:
SELECT DISTINCT point, date, SUM(out) AS outcome, SUM(inc) AS income
FROM (SELECT Income.point, Income.date, out, inc
FROM Income LEFT JOIN Outcome ON Income.point = Outcome.point AND Income.date = Outcome.date AND Income.code = Outcome.code
UNION ALL
SELECT Outcome.point, Outcome.date, out, inc
FROM Outcome LEFT JOIN Income ON Income.point = Outcome.point AND Income.date = Outcome.date AND Income.code = Outcome.code) AS p
GROUP BY point, date

Exercise: 59 (Serge I: 2003-02-15)
Calculate the cash balance of each buy-back center for the database with money transactions being
recorded not more than once a day.
Result set: point, balance.

Solution:
WITH i AS
(SELECT point, SUM(COALESCE(inc,0)) AS sum
FROM Income_o
GROUP BY point),

o AS
(SELECT point, SUM(COALESCE(out,0)) AS sum
FROM Outcome_o
GROUP BY point)

SELECT COALESCE(i.point, o.point) AS point, COALESCE(i.sum,0)-COALESCE(o.sum,0) AS rem
FROM i LEFT JOIN o ON i.point = o.point

####################################################
Exercise: 60 (Serge I: 2003-02-15)
For the database with money transactions being recorded not more than once a day, calculate the cash balance of
each buy-back center at the beginning of 4/15/2001.
Note: exclude centers not having any records before the specified date.
Result set: point, balance

Solution:
WITH i AS
(SELECT point, SUM(COALESCE(inc,0)) AS sum
FROM Income_o
WHERE date < '2001-04-15'
GROUP BY point),

o AS
(SELECT point, SUM(COALESCE(out,0)) AS sum
FROM Outcome_o
WHERE date < '2001-04-15'
GROUP BY point)

SELECT COALESCE(i.point, o.point) AS point, COALESCE(i.sum,0)-COALESCE(o.sum,0) AS rem
FROM i LEFT JOIN o ON i.point = o.point

####################################################
Exercise: 61 (Serge I: 2003-02-14)
For the database with money transactions being recorded not more than once a day, calculate the total cash
balance of all buy-back centers.

Solution:
SELECT COALESCE(i.sum,0) - COALESCE(o.sum,0) AS rem
FROM (SELECT COALESCE(SUM(inc),0) AS sum FROM Income_o) i,
	(SELECT COALESCE(SUM(out),0) AS sum FROM Outcome_o) o

####################################################
Exercise: 62 (Serge I: 2003-02-15)
For the database with money transactions being recorded not more than once a day, calculate the total cash
balance of all buy-back centers at the beginning of 04/15/2001.

Solution:
SELECT COALESCE(i.sum,0) - COALESCE(o.sum,0) AS rem
FROM (SELECT COALESCE(SUM(inc),0) AS sum FROM Income_o WHERE date < '2001-04-15') i,
	(SELECT COALESCE(SUM(out),0) AS sum FROM Outcome_o WHERE date < '2001-04-15') o

Exercise: 64 (Serge I: 2010-06-04)
Using the Income and Outcome tables, determine for each buy-back center the days when it received funds but
made no payments, and vice versa.
Result set: point, date, type of operation (inc/out), sum of money per day.

Solution:
WITH inData AS
(SELECT point, date, 'inc' AS operation, SUM(inc) AS sum
FROM Income i
WHERE date NOT IN (SELECT date FROM Outcome WHERE i.date = date AND i.point = point)
GROUP BY point, date),
outData AS
(SELECT point, date, 'out' AS operation, SUM(out) AS sum
FROM Outcome o
WHERE date NOT IN (SELECT date FROM Income WHERE o.date = date AND o.point = point)
GROUP BY point, date)

SELECT *
FROM (SELECT * FROM inData UNION ALL SELECT * FROM outData) p
ORDER BY point, date

Exercise: 69 (Serge I: 2011-01-06)
Using the Income and Outcome tables, find out the balance for each buy-back center by the end of each day when
funds were received or payments were made.
Note that the cash isn’t withdrawn, and the unspent balance/debt is carried forward to the next day.
Result set: buy-back center ID (point), date in dd/mm/yyyy format, unspent balance/debt by the end of this day.

Solution:
WITH a AS
(SELECT point, date, inc, 0 AS out
FROM Income
UNION ALL
SELECT point, date, 0 AS inc, out
FROM Outcome o),
everyDayRem AS
(SELECT point, date, SUM(inc) AS inco, SUM(out) AS outo
FROM a
GROUP BY point, date)

SELECT point, CONVERT(varchar(10), date, 103) AS d,
		(SELECT SUM(inco-outo) rem
		FROM everyDayRem
		WHERE point = e.point AND date <= e.date) rem
FROM everyDayRem e
